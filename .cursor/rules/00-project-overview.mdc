## Primary goals
- Keep UI **consistent, composable, and responsive**.
- Prefer **reusable primitives** (components + composables) over repeated inline patterns.
- Keep client/server behavior predictable (SSR-safe where needed).

## Data + API calling
- All API calls must go through `useApiClient()` (no ad-hoc `apiBaseUrl`/`joinUrl`/`credentials` duplication).
- Parse API errors via `getApiErrorMessage()`; show a helpful message inline.
- Successful responses should assume `{ data: ... }` envelope.

## Auth + routing
- Cookie-based auth; always call with `credentials: include` (handled by `useApiClient()`).
- Do not duplicate auth hydration logic:
  - use `useAuth().initAuth()` / `ensureLoaded()` only.
- Admin pages must be hidden from non-admins:
  - use middleware that returns **404** for non-admins.

## Layout rules
- Route-based layout behavior belongs in `useLayoutRules()` (not inline in layouts/pages).
- Complex scroll behavior belongs in a composable (`useCoupledScroll()`).
- For master/detail pages (messages/admin):
  - on tiny viewports show **one pane** at a time (list OR detail).

## UI primitives
- Prefer shared components for repeated patterns:
  - alerts (`AppInlineAlert`)
  - headers (`AppPageHeader`)
  - verified badge (`AppVerifiedBadge`)
- Keep badges/icons visually consistent across pages.

## Styling
- Tailwind utilities are fine, but avoid repeating long class strings across pages.
- Prefer subtle animations and stable layout (avoid jumpy transitions).

## Workflow expectations
- After substantive changes, run:
  - `npx nuxi typecheck`
  - `npm run build` (when relevant)
