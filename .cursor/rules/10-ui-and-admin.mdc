description: Nuanced UI/admin conventions for menofhunger-www.

## Admin UX expectations
- Admin entry point should be **subtle but clear**, and only visible for admins.
- `/admin` uses app layout but forces:
  - compact left rail
  - no right rail
- Admin UI should show “read-only but important” details in a clear block:
  - user id, joined time, username locked, site admin, verification status/timestamps

## Verification badge
- Use the shared verified badge component (`AppVerifiedBadge`) everywhere.
- Tooltip must explain whether verification is **identity** or **manual**.
- Badge should look like Twitter’s: blue circle + white check and work in dark mode.

## Username editing conventions
- Public username setting is stricter; enforce in Settings.
- Allow “case-only” change for a user’s own username once set.
- Admin edit can be looser, but must:
  - show availability check state (spinner / check / x)
  - disable save when invalid
