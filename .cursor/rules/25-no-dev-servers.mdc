## Dev servers / watchers

- **Do not run** `npm run dev` (or other long-running dev servers/watchers).
- Assume the USER already has dev servers running for both `menofhunger-api` and `menofhunger-www` and that they auto-reload on file changes.
- If a server restart is required (rare), **tell the USER what command to run**, but do not run it yourself.
